                        <span> JAMES L. CLAYTON DISTINGUISHED RESEARCH CHAIR</span>
                        <p>
                            This year the History Department is pleased to announce the creation of the James L.
                            Clayton Distinguished Research Chair in the Department of History. This is an innovative
                            award created to honor our recently retired colleague, Jim Clayton, and offer vital support
                            to especially promising research projects in the department. Jim served the History
                            Department and the University of Utah with the highest distinction for forty years. He
                            published six books and nearly two-dozen articles on a variety of topics, particularly in
                            US economic history. His classes on American Constitutional History, Economic History,
                            and the Nature and Functions of Law were legendary among our students. Excellence
                            in the classroom brought him the Distinguished Honors Professor Award, the University
                            of Utah Distinguished Teaching Award, and a University Professorship. In addition, Jim
                            served as director of the Honors Program, Dean of the Graduate School, and University
                            Provost.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Designed to further the History Department’s research mission, The Clayton Distinguished
                            Research Chair is awarded to a member of the department for a two-year term. During
                            that time, the faculty member will receive an enhanced salary, a reduced teaching load,
                            a research fund, and a research assistant to help complete an especially promising
                            scholarly project. The criteria for the award state that its recipient should have “an
                            established pattern of excellence in research and teaching” and a “strong record of
                            service,” and should also be pursuing an imaginative and creative project that is “likely
                            to be substantially completed during the two-year term.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through the generosity of many of Jim’s students, colleagues, and friends, the History
                            Department has raised approximately half of the $600,000 endowment necessary to
                            sustain the award in perpetuity. We continue to seek support for this endowment. If
                            you are interested, please click here for more information.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we seek to complete the endowment campaign, the History Department is pleased
                            to announce that Ray Gunn, longtime member of the department and past Department
                            Chair, has been selected as the first Clayton Distinguished Research Chair recipient.
                            The selection committee found Ray’s project, “Bloody Spring: Murder, Retribution, and
                            Justice Denied in a Texas Town,” to be “creative, well written, carefully organized, and
                            vitally engaged with the literature. When completed, it will have a profound impact on
                            the field and offer new interpretive insights on race and violence in American History.”
                            Ray’s record as a scholar, a teacher, a department administrator, and a colleague deeply
                            involved in the life of the university make him an ideal choice as the first James L.
                            Clayton Research Professor in the Department of History.
